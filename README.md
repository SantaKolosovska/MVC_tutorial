I think it was sections 11 (Spring MVC - Building Spring web apps), 12 (Spring MVC - Creating controllers and views,
13 (Spring MVC - Request params and request mappings)

Tutorial uses JSP, but I use html and thymeleaf (because I created a Spring Boot project instead of a Spring one and 
had no experience with JSP it seemed easier to use html)
